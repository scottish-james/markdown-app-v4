Diagram Analyzer - v19 Scoring System for PowerPoint Diagram Detection
Analyzes slide content to identify potential diagrams with probability scoring

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
The v19 scoring system uses a sophisticated rule-based approach to identify
slides that likely contain diagrams. It analyzes shape composition, spatial
layout, text characteristics, and flow patterns to calculate a probability
score for diagram presence.

SCORING METHODOLOGY:
- Rule-based scoring: Multiple independent criteria contribute to total score
- Weighted importance: Different indicators have different point values
- Probability mapping: Raw scores are converted to percentage probabilities
- Threshold filtering: Only slides above 40% probability are considered diagrams

ANALYSIS CATEGORIES:
1. Shape composition: Lines, arrows, shape variety
2. Spatial layout: Grid patterns, distribution analysis
3. Text characteristics: Short labels vs long paragraphs
4. Flow indicators: Process keywords, workflow terms
5. Negative indicators: Content that suggests non-diagram slides

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Operates on structured data (not raw PowerPoint objects)
- Computational complexity scales linearly with shape count
- Memory efficient - processes one slide at a time
- Fast enough for real-time analysis of typical presentations

class DiagramAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes structured slide data to identify potential diagrams.

    COMPONENT RESPONSIBILITIES:
    - Score individual slides for diagram probability
    - Categorize slide elements (shapes, lines, arrows, text)
    - Analyze spatial layouts and flow patterns
    - Generate detailed analysis reports with reasoning
    - Convert raw scores to meaningful probability percentages

    SCORING SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
    The v19 system uses additive scoring where multiple rules contribute
    points based on diagram indicators. The system is designed to be:
    - Extensible: New rules can be added easily
    - Tunable: Point values can be adjusted based on empirical data
    - Explainable: Each score includes reasoning for transparency

    INPUT DATA FORMAT:
    Expects structured data from ContentExtractor with shape classification
    and positional information. Does not directly access PowerPoint objects.

        PROCESSING PIPELINE:
        1. Iterate through all slides in structured data
        2. Score each slide using v19 scoring system
        3. Filter slides meeting probability threshold (40%+)
        4. Generate comprehensive analysis summary
        5. Return formatted summary or None if no diagrams found

        THRESHOLD RATIONALE:
        40% probability threshold balances sensitivity vs specificity:
        - Lower thresholds: Too many false positives (text slides)
        - Higher thresholds: Miss borderline diagrams with few indicators
        - 40% empirically provides good diagram detection accuracy

        SUMMARY FORMAT:
        Provides actionable information for downstream processing:
        - Slide numbers with diagram probability
        - Score breakdown with reasoning
        - Shape counts for quick assessment
        - Analysis method identification (v19)

        - No rule dependencies or complex interactions
        - Multiple rules can trigger simultaneously
        - Higher scores indicate stronger diagram evidence

        Detect patterns that suggest non-diagram content.

        NEGATIVE INDICATOR PURPOSE:
        Some patterns strongly suggest document slides rather than
        diagrams. These indicators subtract from the total score to
        reduce false positives.

        ANTI-PATTERNS DETECTED:
        1. Long paragraphs: Document-style content (>20 words)
        2. Heavy bullet point usage: List-heavy presentations
        3. Single column layout: Linear text arrangement

        TEXT ANALYSIS:
        - Counts paragraphs with >20 words (document indicator)
        - Calculates ratio of bullet points to total paragraphs
        - High ratios suggest list slides rather than diagrams

        LAYOUT ANALYSIS:
        Measures horizontal spread of shapes. Very narrow spreads
        suggest single-column text layouts typical of bullet slides.

        PENALTY SCORING:
        - 2+ long paragraphs: -15 points

        PROBABILITY MAPPING:

        SCORE RANGES:
        - 60+ points: 95% probability (very strong indicators)

        CALIBRATION RATIONALE:
